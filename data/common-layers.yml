    label: Electricity demand target
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines the electricity demand target expressed in kWh/capita/year. The top-down scenarios introduce consistent Tier-based demand targets across all settlements based on their urban (U) and rural (R) status. In the low demand scenario, the urban demand target is informed by the average consumption observed in currently electrified areas in the country, translated into the nearest access Tier (e.g. U4 – Urban Tier 4). Low rural demand target is always set to Tier 1 (e.g. R1 – Rural Tier 1). The high demand target scenario reflects more aggressive goals. Urban demand target is increased by 1 Tier, unless already Tier 5, while rural demand target is increased by 2 Tiers. The bottom-up scenario assigns a unique demand target (kWh/cap/year) in each settlement, based on local poverty rate and GDP level.'

    description:

    label: Grid generating cost of electricity
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines different average costs of generating electricity by the power plants connected to the national grid. This cost is one of the factors that affect the LCoE of connecting to the grid (together with extension of the grid lines etc.), and can affect the split between grid- and off-grid technologies.'

    label: PV system cost 
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines the role of PV system costs on electrification results. It should be noted that the stand-alone PV costs, as used in GEP, reflect both PV module cost and Balance of System (BoS) expressed in $/kW. Expected PV cost scenario considers PV system costs as expected to vary in the modeling period. Low PV cost scenario considers PV system costs decreased by 50% compared to the expected scenario values.'

    description: 
     'Definition: Definition: Examines the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025). In the GEP it is assumed that final electrification rate is 100%, analysis considers 10 years (2020-2030) with an intermediate time step of 5 years. Not capped scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases linearly over the modelling years; no restrictions are set in terms of feasible grid connections per year. Capped growth scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases as in the first scenario but is subject to a maximum grid connections limitation, equal to 2.5% of population per year'

    label: Rollout plan
    description: 
     'Definition: Definition: Examines the potential of electrification rollout plans for the country. Nationwide least-cost approach works as follows: First, connections are ramped up in all already grid connected settlements. Then, un-electrified settlements are prioritized based on lowest investment cost per capita until the target electrification rate is reached. Note! a generation capacity limit for the centralized grid is applied in order to keep grid expansion to sensible levels. Grid connection within 2 km presents a rollout plan that considers “forced” grid connection in all settlements located within 2 km from existing MV network. Beyond 2 km of the MV-lines the least-cost technology is selected.'
