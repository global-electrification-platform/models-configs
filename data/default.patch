      'Definition: Definition: Examines the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025). In the GEP it is assumed that final electrification rate is 100%, analysis considers 10 years (2020-2030) with an intermediate time step of 5 years. Not capped scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases linearly over the modelling years; no restrictions are set in terms of feasible grid connections per year. Capped growth scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases as in the first scenario but is subject to a maximum grid connections limitation, equal to 2.5% of population per year'
