    description: 
     'Definition: Examines different population growth projections until the end year of the analysis (2030). Annual growth variants (2018-2030) were retrieved from UN Population database. Medium population growth scenario uses the medium growth variant; High population growth scenario uses the high growth variant.'

    label: Electricity demand target
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines the electricity demand target expressed in kWh/capita/year. The top-down scenarios introduce consistent Tier-based demand targets across all settlements based on their urban (U) and rural (R) status. In the low demand scenario, the urban demand target is informed by the average consumption observed in currently electrified areas in the country, translated into the nearest access Tier (e.g. U4 – Urban Tier 4). Low rural demand target is always set to Tier 1 (e.g. R1 – Rural Tier 1). The high demand target scenario reflects more aggressive goals. Urban demand target is increased by 1 Tier, unless already Tier 5, while rural demand target is increased by 2 Tiers. The bottom-up scenario assigns a unique demand target (kWh/cap/year) in each settlement, based on local poverty rate and GDP level.'

    label: Intermediate investment plan
    description: 
     'Definition: Indicates the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025). In GEP it is assumed that final electrification rate is 100%, analysis considers 12 years (2018-2030) with an intermediate time step of 7 years. Not capped scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases linearly over the modelling years; no restrictions are set in terms of feasible grid connections per year. Capped growth scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases as in the first scenario but is subject to grid connections limitation, equal to 2.5% of population per year. In this case, grid electrified population slowly ramps up over the years of analysis following often an S-like curve.'

    label: Grid generating cost of electricity
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines different average costs of generating electricity by the power plants connected to the national grid. This cost is one of the factors that affect the LCoE of connecting to the grid (together with extension of the grid lines etc.), and can affect the split between grid- and off-grid technologies. Estimated on-grid cost scenario assumes an optimal generating cost of electricity by the central grid based on the Electricity Model Base for Africa (TEMBA).  High on-grid cost scenario assumes a generating cost of electricity by the central grid increased by 25% so as to account for deviations from the optimal plan (construction delays, deployment of emergency fossil fuel based units etc.), which can increase generating cost affecting thus the split between grid- and off-grid technologies.'

    label: PV system cost 
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines the role of PV system costs on electrification results. It should be noted that these costs, as used in GEP, reflect both PV module cost and Balance of System (BoS) expressed in $/kW. Expected PV cost scenario considers PV system costs as expected to vary in the modeling period. Low PV cost scenario considers PV system costs decreased by 25% compared to the expected scenario values. High PV cost scenario considers PV system costs increased by 25% compared to the expected scenario values.'

    label: Rollout plan
    description: 
     'Definition: Examines the potential of electrification rollout plans for the country. Nationwide least cost approach works as follows: First, connections are ramped up in all already grid connected settlements. Then, un-electrified settlements are prioritized based on lowest investment cost per capita until the target electrification rate is reached. Note! a grid generation capacity limit per year is applied in order to keep grid expansion to sensible levels. Densification scenario indicates (only) the potential of "forced" grid connection to all settlements within 1km from existing MV lines. Intensification scenario indicates (only) the potential of "forced" grid connection to all settlements within 2km from existing MV lines.'
